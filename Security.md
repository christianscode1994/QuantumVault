Security
This repository is an experimental hackathon prototype and is not audited. It is provided as-is under the MIT License. Do not use any code from this repo with real assets or in production environments.

Reporting Vulnerabilities
Preferred channel: Open a GitHub Security Advisory for this repository.

Alternative channel: Email detailed reports to fourieranalys@hotmail.com.

Do not open a public issue to report a vulnerability; public issues may expose details and put users at risk.

What to Include in a Report
Provide enough detail for maintainers to reproduce and triage the issue quickly:

Title summarizing the issue.

Affected components with file paths and relevant versions.

Detailed description including exact reproduction steps and observed behavior.

Proof of concept or minimal exploit code if available, targeted at local test environments or simulators.

Suggested severity and potential impact.

Preferred contact for follow-up.

Response and Triage
Acknowledgement: We will acknowledge receipt via the reporting channel.

Triage: Reports will be triaged and assigned an owner for investigation.

Fixing: Critical issues will be prioritized; fixes or mitigations will be proposed as soon as reasonably possible.

Coordination: We will coordinate disclosure timelines with the reporter and may request additional information or tests.

Public disclosure: Details will not be publicly disclosed until an appropriate fix or mitigation is available or agreed with the reporter.

Scope and Limitations
Prototype scope: Code in this repository is demonstration-level and intended for hackathon use only. Cryptographic components are simulation or prototype implementations and are not secure for production use.

No warranty: Maintainers disclaim all warranties and liability under the MIT License.

No financial responsibility: Maintainers are not responsible for losses resulting from use of prototype code. Do not use this software with real funds.

Safe Testing Guidance
Test only on local environments or testnets and with simulated keys.

Never use real private keys or real funds when reproducing issues.

Provide deterministic test vectors where possible to speed triage.

Share minimal reproducible examples rather than full production data.

Contact and Private Disclosure
For private disclosure via email send to fourieranalys@hotmail.com and mark the message as sensitive. Include encrypted attachments if you prefer confidentiality.

If you use GitHub Security Advisory, include a link to the advisory in your email for coordination.

After a Fix
Fixed issues will be documented in a changelog entry and a commit referencing the issue or advisory.

We will provide recommended mitigations and updated test vectors where applicable.

Reminder This project is a hackathon demo. Any vulnerability reports are appreciated and will be handled responsibly, but the code should not be trusted for production use.
